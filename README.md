This repository demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Docker. It includes a `Jenkinsfile` that defines pipeline stages for pulling code from GitHub, building a Docker image, running the container on port 8081(I changed the port number cause of some issues), and cleaning up unused images. The project requires Jenkins, Docker, and Git installed on the server, with GitHub integration enabled. To use it, set up a Jenkins Pipeline job with the SCM pointing to this repo (`https://github.com/Fizza424/Jenkins-Docker.git`), specify the branch as `main`, and trigger builds on code changes. The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:8081` once the container is running.
Im also attaching the console ouput file too.
